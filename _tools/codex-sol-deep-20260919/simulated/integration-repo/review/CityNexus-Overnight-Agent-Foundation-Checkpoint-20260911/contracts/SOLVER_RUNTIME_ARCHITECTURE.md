# Solver Runtime Architecture Contract

## First increment: replacement-window CP-SAT

Do not begin with a general TSP or full-day route optimizer. The safest first real solver target is the disrupted mutable slot between the current execution position and the next protected C4 anchor.

Activities outside the disrupted slot are copied unchanged in V1. Completed prefix remains immutable. C4 stays fixed by durable semantic/time anchor and is checked again by the existing gate.

## Why this is already a real solver

CP-SAT is choosing among alternatives **and** solving a constrained start time using opening windows, budget, frozen travel, Journey horizon, and protected-anchor arrival. It is not merely selecting a pre-scored card.

The model can later expand to optional insertion, multiple mutable activities, ordering and multi-anchor scheduling after this boundary is proven.

## Pure input rule

Solver input may contain only frozen primitive/value data. Do not pass:

- SQLAlchemy model/session;
- FastAPI Request/Depends;
- HTTP client/provider;
- live Valhalla/Open-Meteo adapter;
- mutable JourneyTwin projection.

## Determinism

Use stable sorting, `num_search_workers = 1`, fixed `random_seed`, bounded solve time and stable post-gate ranking. If time budget returns UNKNOWN, do not materialize a half-trusted assignment.

## Top-K

V1 should return distinct option assignments, not ten start-minute variants for the same place. After each accepted solver assignment, exclude that option/drop assignment and solve again until K, INFEASIBLE, UNKNOWN, or exhaustion.

## Weather note

Current WEATHER Replan conservatively translates a weather-hit place to a global `PLACE_UNAVAILABLE` disruption constraint. Keep that behavior for Solver V1 so the authoritative gate and solver stay aligned. A later Solver V2 may add a deterministic time-bounded weather constraint so the same outdoor Place can be moved outside the hazardous forecast interval. Do **not** let OR-Tools alone invent that semantic before the gate understands it too.
