 * One shared reading of how much of a plan's budget is actually evidenced.
 *
 * "At least one priced stop" is not a budget verdict.  One known price beside
 * thirteen unknown ones does not verify a total, and a stop with no provider
 * price is not a free stop.
 *
 *   NONE    — no reliable price evidence at all; the total is unknown.
 *   PARTIAL — some prices are known; the total is still unknown, so no
 *             "within / near / over budget" verdict may be shown.
 *   FULL    — every budget-relevant component carries reliable evidence; only
 *             here may a budget verdict be shown.
 *
 * A zero amount can be *known free*, which is real evidence — it must not fall
 * back to "unknown" merely because the number is zero.
