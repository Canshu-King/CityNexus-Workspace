"""V4 #5 sentinel: prove the per-module mobility helper cannot neutralise B1.

For every module subset the helper ships, assert that:
  * the table is genuinely minimal (a handful of legs, no self-pair, no
    accidental complete-graph / universal-value table);
  * a declared leg becomes an EXPLICIT_FROZEN_FIXTURE fact; and
  * a leg outside the subset stays SYNTHETIC_DEFAULT — the blanket default that
    hard feasibility must refuse (T2 / B1).

This is the per-module form of the sentinel GPT asked for (LEGACY_TEST_FIXTURE_
GATE / v4 #5): narrowing the shared table must not have quietly turned
"missing mobility" into "known mobility" for any module.
