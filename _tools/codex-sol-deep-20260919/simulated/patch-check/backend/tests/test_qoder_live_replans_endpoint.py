"""T2 v5 blocker-1 — REAL /replans path with a live provider configured.

V4 closed the *primitive* (`require_explicit_facts` hard capture never falls back
to mock) and the *offline* endpoint (no explicit fact -> refused), but GPT found
the real bypass: ``generate_replan`` does its initial BULK mobility capture
through the *soft* runtime path.  With a live routing provider configured, a leg
the live provider failed would fall back to the deterministic mock, and if that
leg happened to be an explicit demo-matrix pair it was tagged
``EXPLICIT_FROZEN_FIXTURE`` -> accepted by ``hard_minutes()`` -> the later strict
per-pair recapture never fired.  Two tests each green, the composition leaky.

These drive the actual ``POST /api/v1/journeys/{id}/replans`` with live routing
configured and a fake Valhalla that fails specific legs the mock still has as
explicit fixture facts, proving the bypass is closed and candidate behaviour is
preserved.

Layer label: API/service integration (live-provider composition).
