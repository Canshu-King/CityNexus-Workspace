/**
 * T3 — acknowledgement vs resolution semantics (docs/ACK_RESOLUTION_CONTRACT.md).
 *
 * `ACKNOWLEDGED != RESOLVED`.  A disruption the traveller has merely seen must
 * stay actionable; only RESOLVED, IGNORED, or an accepted replan linked to that
 * event closes it.  Today and Live must agree on the same event.
 *
 * LAYER: unit.  The shared rule lives in a dependency-free module both surfaces
 * import, so this pins the contract's logic.  A rendered Today/Live integration
 * test (mocking the experience API so the real components paint) is tracked as a
 * remaining evidence gap for v2 in the handoff — it is NOT claimed here.
