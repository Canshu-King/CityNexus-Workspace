"""Journey-scoped serialization, acceptance races, and commitment re-binding.

Four defects from the Sol verification, closed here with the assertions the
ruling asked for: a race test that only checks status codes proves nothing,
because two callers can both return 200 while the database ends up with two
ACTIVE plans.  Every schedule below asserts the final canonical state:

    exactly one ACTIVE PlanVersion
    the Journey points at that one
    exactly one ACCEPTED proposal claiming the win
    zero active commitments anchored outside the active plan

Schedules are made to overlap with a barrier rather than with sleeps: a sleep is
a guess about timing, and a guess that passes is not evidence.
