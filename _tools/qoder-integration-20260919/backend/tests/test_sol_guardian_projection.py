"""Pin the two projection contracts the pass-16 arbitration asked for.

`V14PreventivePanel` used to take `runs[0]` as "the newest preventive run" and to
stop polling the moment any run appeared.  The arbitration ruled that neither may
rest on a guess:

  * if the endpoint guarantees newest-first, that guarantee needs a test;
  * if it does not, the panel must select by `created_at`.

It does guarantee it - `guardian_status` sorts `created_at desc, id desc` - so the
ordering is pinned here, and the panel still selects by `created_at` rather than by
position, so a future change to that sort cannot make the surface describe a stale
run.

The second case is the lifecycle one: a `GuardianRun` is written RUNNING/PLANNING
before the recomposition lands, so "a run exists" must never be treated as "the
story is finished".  The panel's stop condition is asserted against the payload it
actually receives.
