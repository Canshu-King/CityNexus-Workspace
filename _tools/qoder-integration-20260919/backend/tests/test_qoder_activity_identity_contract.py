"""Activity identity contract across a replan (pass-16 C).

Measured in the field, not theorised: pass-15 found that after an accepted
recovery, `GET /api/v1/journeys/{id}/experience` reported `place_id: null` for
**every** activity while `GET /api/v1/plans/{id}` for the very same child plan
version still had all six.  The identity was not lost when the child plan was
created — it was dropped by the consumer projection, which left the phone with
titles as its only handle.  A title is localisable, renameable, can collide, and
is not a key, so "is the protected commitment still here?" silently degraded into
a string match.

Contract this pins:

* every projected activity exposes a stable `place_id`;
* an activity the recovery did not touch keeps the *same* `place_id` it had on the
  plan the traveller selected;
* a replacement activity is not left anonymous — it exposes its real `place_id`;
* the canonical plan projection and the /experience projection agree, because they
  describe the same rows.

Fixing this in the frontend by looking a title up in a place table is explicitly
not acceptable, and this test is the reason: it compares the two server
projections, so a client-side patch would leave it red.
