"""Canonical C4 anchor identity.

A confirmed reservation becomes a ``C4_Anchored`` Commitment.  That commitment
must carry **one** stable semantic location identity that every stage of the
pipeline agrees on:

    generation -> C4 commitment -> frozen mobility evidence -> PlanVersion
    persistence -> selection -> booking -> start -> replanning

Historically ARRIVAL and DEPARTURE anchors were stored as synthetic UUIDs with
no corresponding routable node, so no generator could ever emit a matching
activity and every plan was rejected with ``LOCKED_COMMITMENT_LOST``.

The model is:

    ``Activity.metadata.semantic_key``  - stable routing/feasibility identity
    ``Activity.place_id``              - concrete database Place identity

For ARRIVAL / DEPARTURE the semantic key is the *structural anchor* key that
the authoritative planner materialises (``arrival-anchor`` /
``departure-anchor``).  For MID_TRIP it is the user-selected place or service
key.  When a location genuinely cannot be resolved the temporal commitment is
preserved and the unresolved location is recorded explicitly - the anchor is
never silently reported as satisfied.
