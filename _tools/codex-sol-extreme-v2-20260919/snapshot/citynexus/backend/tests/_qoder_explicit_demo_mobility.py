"""Test-side helper: seed scenario-declared EXPLICIT mobility legs (per module).

V2-B1 (closed in v3) made the real replan path refuse the mock fixture's blanket
``default_minutes=20`` as a hard-feasibility fact.  Several pre-existing replan
tests were written against the OLD behaviour where the offline demo silently used
that default, so once B1 is closed they fail with ``MOBILITY_DATA_UNAVAILABLE``.

The v2 helper generated a complete graph at one invented value and autoused it
module-wide (rejected by V3 review).  The v3 helper used a single ~25-pair table
shared by every module via autouse — still broader than needed: a module gained
route legs unrelated to its own scenarios (V4 #5).

V4 #5 narrows this to a per-module minimal subset: each module seeds only the
exact legs its replan scenarios actually traverse (discovered empirically — see
the module->legs mapping in TEST_RESULTS).  These are *explicit deterministic
fixture facts* the scenario declares, each carrying the same real duration as
the historical offline fixture.  They are NOT live/Xiamen measurements.  Any
pair outside a module's subset stays unseeded and resolves to the mock blanket
default, which the fail-closed classifier marks SYNTHETIC_DEFAULT and hard
feasibility rejects — so B1 stays intact (the sentinel in
test_qoder_mobility_replan_endpoint proves this).
