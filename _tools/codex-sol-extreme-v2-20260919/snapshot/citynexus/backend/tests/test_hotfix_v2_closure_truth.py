"""Hotfix v2 regressions: closure truth and deterministic target resolution.

Covers the two P0/P1 blockers found by the independent v2 recheck:

* R1-a — an imported booking commitment has ``activity_id = None``, so the old
  protection test ``affected_activity_id in {row.activity_id ...}`` evaluated
  ``None in {None}`` and rejected every closure on a booking-first journey with
  a false "protected" 422.
* R1-b — a named venue that is not passed as ``affected_activity_id`` must
  resolve deterministically, and an ambiguous name must not be guessed.
