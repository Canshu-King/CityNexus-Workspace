/**
 * One shared reading of a disruption's lifecycle state.
 *
 * The product rule is `ACKNOWLEDGED != RESOLVED`: acknowledging a disruption
 * means the traveller has seen it, not that a recovery was chosen.  Only
 * RESOLVED, IGNORED, or an accepted replan explicitly linked to the event
 * closes it.
 *
 * Both Today (V8Experience) and Live (LiveRecovery) read this module so the
 * two surfaces cannot disagree about the same event — the earlier split let
 * Today keep saying "1 项变化" while Live said there was nothing to decide.
 *
 * Contract: docs/ACK_RESOLUTION_CONTRACT.md
