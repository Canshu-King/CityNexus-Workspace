"""Canonical traveler capability and accessibility contract.

Capability interpretation is intentionally small and deterministic.  DeepSeek
may suggest items, but this module owns the vocabulary, severity defaults and
the conversion of explicit capability state into the existing Journey
constraint shape consumed by the feasibility gate.

The module is deliberately independent of FastAPI/SQLAlchemy so it can be
used by semantic compilation, planning and focused contract tests alike.
