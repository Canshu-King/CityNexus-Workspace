    ``Commitment.activity_id`` belongs to a particular PlanVersion and therefore
    is not a stable cross-version identity.  The WP04 policy stores the stable
    semantic key and scheduled start; those facts are the authoritative anchor
    used for replanning.

    The emitted ``semantic_ref`` is always a key a generator can actually
    satisfy: the structural arrival/departure node, or the real MID_TRIP
    place/service.  A genuinely unresolved location keeps its temporal
    commitment and is reported explicitly instead of pretending to be met.
